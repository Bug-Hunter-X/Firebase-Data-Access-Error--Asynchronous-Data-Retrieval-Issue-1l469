The Firebase SDK may throw an error if you try to access a property of a document snapshot before the snapshot has been fully populated. This can happen if you try to access the data asynchronously without properly handling the promise or the asynchronous nature of the Firebase SDK. For example, if you fetch data using `get()` and immediately access a field without awaiting the promise, you'll likely encounter this error.  Another example is using a callback inside an asynchronous function without correctly handling the result. This usually leads to undefined values or errors.
