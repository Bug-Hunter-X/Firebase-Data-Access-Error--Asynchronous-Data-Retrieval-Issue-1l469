This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase applications where accessing document snapshot properties before the data is fully loaded results in undefined values. The `bug.js` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version with proper asynchronous handling.  This issue is prevalent when working with asynchronous operations in JavaScript and interacting with Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore.
